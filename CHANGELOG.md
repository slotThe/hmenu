## Added
-   Users may now specify directories in the files list.  This lists all their
    contents and puts those files in the list.
-   New command line option `--histFile` (short: `f`) to specify a history file
    to use.
-   New command line option `--files-only` (short: `o`) to *only* show the
    user-defined files.

## Changed
-   We now explicitly ignore directories in when they occur as sub directories
    of specified paths.

    if the selected item was in the files list.
