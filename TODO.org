* General [1/4]                                                       :hmenu:
  - [ ] profile to see if using Text and/org Set is worth it
    NOTE: Preliminary testing showed that this has no influence performance wise
    (my guess is that a list of size ~10k is just not big enough for this to
    matter), and does in fact increase memory usage a bit (in both cases, did
    not test them together).
  - [ ] Write readme
  - [ ] Upload this somewhere
  - [ ] Implement new config option to select directories (essentially have
    dmenu act as a file browser for selected directories, this can be used
    e.g. to access a video dir and play videos from there without needing to do
    this in a shell script.)
  - [X] Implement a naive config
