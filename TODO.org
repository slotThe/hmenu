* General [4/4]                                                       :hmenu:
  - [X] Upload this somewhere
  - [X] Write simple readme
  - [X] Implement a naive config

    NOTE: Preliminary testing showed that this has no influence performance wise

    matter), and does in fact increase memory usage a bit (in both cases, did
    not test them together).
