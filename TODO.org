  - [ ] profile to see if using Text and/org Set is worth it
    NOTE: Preliminary testing showed that this has no influence performance wise
    (my guess is that a list of size ~10k is just not big enough for this to
    matter), and does in fact increase memory usage a bit (in both cases, did
    not test them together).
  - [ ] Write readme
  - [ ] Upload this somewhere
  - [X] Implement a naive config
