* General [9/10]                                                      :hmenu:
  - [ ] Command line options for deciding when to refresh the cache.
  - [X] Specify a list of programs to be opened in a (spawned) terminal.
  - [X] More comments.
  - [X] Move to ByteString
  - [X] Write parser instead of using Read instance
  - [X] Display commands in order of usage
  - [X] Upload this somewhere
  - [X] Write simple readme
  - [X] Implement a naive config
  - [X] profile to see if using Text and/or Set is worth it
    NOTE: Preliminary testing showed that this has no influence performance wise
    (my guess is that a list of size ~10k is just not big enough for this to
    matter), and does in fact increase memory usage a bit (in both cases, did
    not test them together).
